# COVID19-Insights: Goldman Sachs Hackathon Project 2020
We analyzed the effect weather conditions had on the spread of new COVID cases around the world. We leveraged the Marquee API, along with the daily temperature dataset from NOAA to attempt to answer how weather may be impacting the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa, Italy and South Korea. 

We chose these countries because we wanted a range of varying climates and we also wanted to select countries that had varying responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, South Korea had the reputation as one of the best responses and Italy was known as one of the initial hot spots. 

We chose the date range of June 1st, 2020 to December 7th, 2020 because we wanted to choose a start date that was after the initial confusion when the pandemic began. At the start of it all, getting a test was very difficult in most countries. Because of this, we suspected data to be inaccurate. This led us to choose the start in the summer because at that point, tests were more easily available.
